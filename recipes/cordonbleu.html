    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>chicken breasts</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>deli ham</li>
        <li>swiss cheese</li>
        <li>all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>dijon mustard</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place a chicken breast on a flat work surface. Slice horizontally through the middle, being careful not to cut all the way through to the other side. Open the 2 sides and spread them out like an open book. Place chicken breast between 2 sheets of heavy plastic on a solid, level surface; lightly pound with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a 1/4-inch thickness. Repeat with remaining chicken breast.</li>
        <li>Season each chicken breast with salt and pepper. Spread Dijon mustard on top. Place 1 slice of cheese on each breast. Top each with 2 slices of ham and 1 slice of cheese. Roll each breast up and secure with a toothpick.</li>
        <li>Place flour in a shallow bowl. Place egg in a second bowl. Mix panko bread crumbs and grated Parmesan in a third bowl.</li>
        <li>Preheat an air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, dredge chicken breasts in flour; shake off excess. Dip into beaten egg, allowing any excess egg to drip back into the bowl. Press into bread crumb mixture to coat both sides; place breaded chicken breasts onto a plate and spray with nonstick spray. Let sit for 5 minutes while the air fryer preheats, then arrange breaded chicken in a single layer in the air fryer basket.</li>
    </ol>
